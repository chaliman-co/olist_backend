## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
A test database has been included in .env, so the app should just work. But feel free to edit the .env file first to update the database url and other necessary environment variables


### `npm run test`

Run all test suites
This will need to connect to the test database and perform a migration so it may take a while to get started. Use a local database for faster running time.
